## Insights and Reflections  

We reached out to **Priyabrata Pattanaik** to learn about their professional journey, reflections on career milestones, and advice for current students navigating their college years. Here's what they had to share:  

1. **Transitioning from College to a Career**:  
   "After graduating from IGIT with a degree in Chemical Engineering, I initially stepped into the corporate world with a mix of curiosity and excitement. The transition from organizing branch events as a secretary, where I honed leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, to the corporate environment was a challenge, but it shaped my adaptability and strategic thinking.  

   Though my academic background was in chemical engineering, my interest in technology led me to the IT sector. Starting from an entry-level role, I quickly realized that the problem-solving and analytical skills I'd developed were highly transferable, even in tech. Over time, I took on more responsibilities, learning new tools and systems, and eventually rose to a team lead position.  

   In that role, I leveraged my organizational and leadership abilities—skills I developed through event management in college—to guide projects, collaborate across teams, and mentor newer team members. So, while the sectors may seem different, the core skills I developed throughout my journey—especially leadership, communication, and adaptability—have been key in shaping my career. It’s been a fulfilling transition from chemical engineering to IT, driven by my passion for tech and continuous learning."  

2. **Importance of CGPA**:  
   "Honestly, CGPA is kind of like a ticket you need to enter the game. It’s important for getting past the initial hurdles, like placements or entrance exams, but it’s definitely not the whole game.  

   For me, it was just a number that showed up on the result sheet, and yeah, it needed to be decent to get through placements or for certain exams, but that was about it. Success is about way more than grades. It’s about how you solve problems, how you work with people, and how you handle failures.  

   In the end, a good CGPA might get you the first opportunity, but it’s your attitude, your skills, and your persistence that actually help you succeed."  

3. **Advice for Students**:  
   "If you're thinking about jumping into the IT field, start prepping from the very first year. Don't wait until placements are around the corner to figure things out. The IT industry moves fast, and there’s so much to learn—coding, problem-solving, data structures, algorithms, and more. The sooner you get a head start, the better.  

   Take advantage of the courses, online resources, and any tech-related events happening. And here’s a big one—don’t hesitate to reach out to alumni. As an IGIT alum myself, I can tell you that we’re always here to help. We’ve been through the grind and know what works and what doesn’t.  

   Having a mentor or just someone to guide you through the process can make a huge difference, whether it’s for internships, tech skills, or career advice. So don’t wait for the perfect moment—start building your network and skillset now! We’re all in this together."  

4. **Cherished College Memories**:  
   "Ah, the memories from IGIT—where do I even begin? From bathing in Brahmani to the carefree days spent at IGIT Goa, late-night dinners at Surya Dhaba with friends were a vibe—just hanging around, laughing, and talking about everything.  

   Then there were those nights, roaming around campus till 5 in the morning, when the world felt peaceful and full of possibilities. It’s these memories that make you realize how important it is to soak in the present, right?  

   I’d say to the current students: enjoy these days! Fall in love, get your heart broken, do all the wrong things—but learn from it—because trust me, those are the lessons that college teaches you. They're the ones that shape who you become, and you’ll carry them with you long after graduation. So make the most of it, just like we did!"
