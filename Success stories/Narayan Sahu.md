## Insights and Reflections
We reached out to Narayan Sahu to learn about their professional journey, reflections on career milestones, and advice for current students navigating their college years. Here's what they had to share:

1. **Career Journey**:  
   "After graduating from IGIT, I didn't have a job in hand. I didn't get selected during my placements in TCS which was the only company came to IGIT. It was a tough ride, but it was worth it. I came to Bangalore after graduation and within 3 months i got a job in Mindtree. From then it has been a great journey."  

2. **Inspiration**:  
   "I was from ETC branch. But I had an interest in IT field, i was very clear from beginning that i will pursue my career in IT, though the path was not clear to me at that time, how to get started. We didn't have so many influencers to get help from and network opportunities that time. We were just enjoying our IGIT days."  

3. **Proudest Achievements**:  
   "Coming from a Tier-3 college and getting into a good company was obviously a dream for me. Still miles to go. But i am really proud of where i am now considering where I come from."  

4. **Role of IGIT**:  
   "Frankly saying, I had a very different journey during my IGIT days. I was always in the stage (less in classrooms), performing for college. I was one of the founding members of the dance group El-diablos. It was few of our seniors and batchmates who started this group and we represented IGIT at CET, Burla, IIT Guwahati and of course at IGIT. Our juniors are taking the legacy of the group forward. These experiences didn't help my career directly but indirectly, as it taught me how to be passionate about something and improved my overall personality."  

5. **Importance of CGPA**:  
   "This is the question I had too, during my IGIT days and I was very worried since I didn't have a very good CGPA. My seniors used to tell me, don't worry about it. But i was still worried. In my opinion, CGPA makes a difference in the short run but not in long run. While stepping into IT, CGPA might help you to get shortlisted to sit for placements but it doesn't matter after that. Now a days , it doesn't really matter, what matters is your skillset and communication skills."  

6. **Advice for Current Students**:  
   "- Make a balance of everything. Study, fun, passion and health.  
   - Don't worry, We are IGITians, we are going to rock and do great things in life."  

7. **Key Lessons from College**:  
   "- Make friends and have fun, you are going to miss it later  
   - Follow a passion and be good at it.  
   - People come and go. But you stick to yourself"  

8. **Best Memory from IGIT**:  
   "Friends , dance practice sessions and being in the stage dancing and looking at the audience cheering for you."  

9. **Additional Insights**:  
   "Laziness kills ambition, jealousy kills peace, anger kills wisdom , fear kills dreams. Now read it in reverse. And yes i copied it from ChatGPTðŸ™ƒ  
   Lastly, thanks to Pritam Acharya for these questions and glad to see IGITians doing such good work."
