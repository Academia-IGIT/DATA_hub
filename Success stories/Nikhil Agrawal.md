## Insights and Reflections

We reached out to Nikhil Agarwal to learn about his professional journey and gather his thoughts on various aspects of career and college life. Here’s what he had to say:

1. **Career Journey**:  
   I started as an ASE at Accenture in 2021 through an off-campus drive. Currently, I’m a QAE-1 at Amazon.

2. **Inspiration**:  
   Passion for coding.

3. **Proudest Achievements**:  
   Not much, but I’m proud of the hard work I do.

4. **Role of IGIT**:  
   IGIT gives you a lot of freedom (especially for guys) to explore your thoughts, build confidence, and face challenges calmly.

5. **Importance of CGPA**:  
   Not much. For corporate jobs, a 7+ CGPA is good enough. For higher studies, it might be more critical, but I am not sure.

6. **Advice for Current Students**:  
   Have a lot of fun. You are in the right place to make memories. Keep in mind what you want to achieve after four years and have a Plan B. Keep your plans rolling slowly but steadily. Always realize when it’s the right time to work as hard as you can.

7. **Key Lessons from College**:  
   Nothing much on academics, but this is the time to make memories. Whenever you look back at these memories, they will always make you smile.

8. **Additional Insights**:  
   College training and placement are of no use. Always keep yourself prepared at the right time so that even if there are fewer chances, you can still make a way in.
