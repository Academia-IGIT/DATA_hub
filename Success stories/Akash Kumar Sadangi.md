## Insights and Reflections  

We reached out to Akash Kumar Sadangi to learn about his professional journey, his leadership as the founder of the Robotics Society at IGIT, and his advice for students navigating their college years. Here's what he had to share:  

1. **Founding the Robotics Society at IGIT**:  
   "During my time at IGIT, I discovered a deep passion for robotics. However, the college didn’t have a robotics community, and resources were extremely limited. Despite these challenges, I decided to take the initiative and establish the Robotics Society from scratch. It wasn’t easy—organizing workshops without proper infrastructure or funding required immense effort. To address this, I started offering both free and paid workshops to gather resources and generate interest. Slowly but steadily, students began showing enthusiasm, and together we built something remarkable. Looking back, the struggle was worth it, as it taught me the value of perseverance, collaboration, and turning challenges into opportunities."  

2. **Career Journey**:  
   "I wasn’t always the most disciplined student—I often skipped classes and interviews and was quite carefree at times. Things changed when I was warned that my name could be barred from future opportunities if I didn’t take things seriously. That was a turning point for me. I attended my first interview, cracked it, and it became the foundation of my IT career. Over time, I did a lot of freelancing and mentoring, which helped me refine my skills and eventually transition to KPMG. The key takeaway? Never consider any job too small; every opportunity matters."  
3. **Importance of CGPA**:  
   "A CGPA of 7 or above is sufficient for most corporate roles. If you're aiming for higher studies, a better CGPA might be important, but the real game-changer is upskilling. Focus on building strong technical skills and, more importantly, on developing your character and personality."  

4. **Advice for Current Students**:  
   "Enjoy your college life, but don’t lose sight of your goals. Relationships and fun are part of the journey, but they should be balanced. By the third year, get serious about your career while cherishing the memories you’ve made. Having a mentor and embracing collaborative learning are absolutely crucial. A good mentor can provide guidance, clarity, and perspective, helping you navigate challenges and make informed decisions. Equally important is community-based learning—working with peers, sharing knowledge, and solving problems together. This collaborative approach not only accelerates your learning but also fosters creativity and resilience. For me, community learning played a significant role in my growth, and it’s something I strongly recommend to everyone. The synergy of shared learning and mentorship can truly unlock your potential and set you on a path to success."  

5. **Lessons from College Life**:  
   "IGIT taught me how to live independently. Being disconnected from urban centers and family pushes you to adapt and grow. When you first join IGIT, you might feel that it’s very disconnected and even think it’s a bad place. But over time, you realize that it’s the memories you create there, especially in the hostel, that stay with you forever. The friendships, late-night talks, and shared experiences make it truly special. Enjoy your first and second years to the fullest—explore, have fun, and build memories. But by the third year, shift your focus entirely to building your career."  

6. **Key Takeaways**:  
   - "Always upskill and be ready for opportunities."  
   - "Never underestimate the power of collaborative learning."  
   - "Seek a mentor to guide you in both personal and professional life."  
   - "The memories you create during your college life will stay with you forever."  

Akash sir’s journey—from founding a robotics society in college to becoming a Senior Consultant at KPMG—serves as an inspiration for students aspiring to excel in their careers. His story emphasizes the value of perseverance, self-improvement, and making the most of every opportunity.
