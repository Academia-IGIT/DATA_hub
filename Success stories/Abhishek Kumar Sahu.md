## Insights and Reflections  

We had the privilege to speak with Abhishek Kumar Sahu about his inspiring professional journey, starting from IGIT to becoming a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in the USA. Here's what he shared:

1. **Career Journey**:  
   "I didn’t have a job when I graduated and worked at a call center for two months. Financial stability was an issue, but I grabbed an opportunity in Bhubaneswar, then moved to Bengaluru, and eventually to the USA. I didn’t even know what QA was when I started. My journey has been about learning and adapting."

2. **Biggest Lessons**:  
   - "99% of people don’t reach their goals because they lack the right mindset and path."  
   - "If I had to start college again, I would enjoy the first two years but focus completely from then on."  

3. **Advice to Students**:  
   - **CGPA Doesn’t Matter Much**: "Your CGPA doesn’t play a big role in your success. Focus instead on your skills and concepts."  
   - **Community-Based Learning**: "Do as much community-based learning as possible. The return on investment from this is far better than anything else you’ll ever experience."  
   - **Core Concepts**: "Ensure you are very good at your core concepts, as that's what truly matters."  
   - **Programming Skills**: "Devote yourself to programming skills like DSA and system design."  
   - **Focus on Understanding**: "Even if you don’t solve many questions, focus on understanding concepts deeply and solving problems effectively."  

4. **Humility and Growth**:  
   - "I don’t think I’m very good at programming; I just study the concept and solve the problem. You will know how good you are at solving the problems as you go."  
   - "Strengthen your core concepts in whatever you do."
