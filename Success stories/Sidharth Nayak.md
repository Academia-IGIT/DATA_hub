## Insights and Reflections

### 1. **Career Journey**  
"After completing my bachelor’s, I took a two-year gap to prepare for entrance exams for PSUs and higher education. This preparation led me to BITS, where I pursued Microelectronics and VLSI. I secured an internship at NVIDIA, which I successfully converted to a full-time role. Currently, I work as a Physical Design Engineer at NVIDIA."

### 2. **Inspiration**  
"There has always been a certain type of life I have wanted to live, be it a tech savvy one or travelling around when I get the opportunity, building up the financials to be able to live this has been a helpful inspiration. And of course, money is not everything if one doesn’t love their work, so I got lucky on that part where I got to love my work as well."
 
### 3. **Role of My Colleges**  
- **IGIT**:  
  "IGIT made me stronger on a different level, there wasn’t much that it offered apart from a great set of friends I still adore and will for my entire life, but from an education point of view things could have been much better. On the brighter side, like people say, if you have lived in IGIT, you can survive anywhere and that was it. The scarcity of resources in the place and my ambitions kind of gave me the patience I needed to take two years off my career path and take the risks to where I am today. 
Journey in BITS was a life changer. Whatever I have now has been because of it, met people from all over the country, great professors and amazing outreach."

### 4. **Importance of CGPA**  
- "It wasn’t much of a deal in BTech during my time in IGIT, placement was scarce. For corporate jobs 7+ is enough. However, in BITS it was a big deal so in Higher Studies always try targeting 8+"

### 5. **Advice for Current Students**  
- "A lot of things must have changed in college by now (hopefully), if not then not to worry, always keep a second plan ready, to know exactly what you desire in the long run. Not all of us had a bright career right after graduation but every one of them are in a much much better position in their career and that’s what the irony of being in that place was, it taught us to be prepared for the worst while looking up for the best version of our life."

### 6. **Additional Inputs**  
- "By the beginning of third year be prepared to keep couple of Back Up Plans, be it prepping for PSUs, UPSC, MBA or GATE exam, since not many resources are around Sarang (Like Bhubaneswar) have to plan things faster and keep yourself mentally ready if things don’t pan out at the end because trust me once you make your mind up, it will.
Participate in events be it inter or intra college. Make memories and experiences worth sharing and living upto."  

**“MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!”**
