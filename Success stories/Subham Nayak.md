## Insights and Reflections  

We had the privilege to speak with Subham Nayak about his inspiring professional journey, from IGIT to becoming an Engineer at Qualcomm. Here's what he shared:

1. **Career Journey**:  
   "In the final year at IGIT, I scored 53 marks in GATE, got a few good tier 1 colleges, but could not get good branches. So I dropped at Kryetrix rank improvement batch in Delhi for 3 months, was able to get 73 marks in the next attempt, and got a seat in IIIT Bangalore to get the VLSI branch as the placement in this branch is 100% with an average salary of 20 LPA."  

2. **Inspiration for Field**:  
   "Limited number of seats in India for VLSI and many openings in many companies. There is nothing like inspiration, frankly speaking, I liked to have a career in Power Electronics, but did not get many good feedbacks from the Power Electronics passed-out alumni, then joined VLSI."  

3. **Career Highlights**:  
   "I got placed in Samsung R&D when COVID was at its peak and hiring was slow. All over India, a total of 60 students were selected, I was one of them."  

4. **Impact of IGIT**:  
   "I have represented the college in badminton for two years and 90% of the time only games. Never touched alcohol and smoking (a few of my friends are at a better place than me who used to do). Night football was started by our batch only. Morning cricket, afternoon 1 or 2 classes max. Evening badminton, night football else volleyball, that was the routine.  

   But me and my friends have cracked the code to get marks, else we were very lucky to study only those questions which were being asked in the examination. Getting marks is not directly proportional to the hours you put into studies. This helped me to get marks in GATE as well as in MTech also."  

5. **Opinion on CGPA**:  
   "Don't get any backlogs in the final year.  
   Get above 6 (as many industries make it a minimum qualification). That's it."  

6. **Advice to IGIT Students**:  
   "Visit IGIT Goa, make as many friends as possible. Please attend the summer coaching in Hyderabad in 3rd year. And enjoy. You will earn crores in life but won’t get IGIT again."  

7. **Key Lessons from College**:  
   "Do previous year questions. There is a limitation of days only, after that start studying for your exams. Don’t blindly study. Be in sports. Do picnics."  

8. **Best Memory from IGIT**:  
   - "Rusticated from Akash Bhavan for playing cricket and shouting in the corridor for 2 months, again warden allowed me to stay."  
   - "Getting selected in the college team of 5 members for badminton." 
   - "Third-year ragging. I was in third year and final-year guys called us for a visit, I was regular to the gym and they asked me for 50 push-ups, even today I don’t know how I did but I completed 100 push-ups. The entire batch clapped and told me Surya Bhavan canteen is always open for me in 3rd year."  

9. **Final Thoughts**:  
   "Everything you do in college and the friends you make are going to stay with you forever."
