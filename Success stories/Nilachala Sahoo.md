## Insights and Reflections  

We reached out to **Nilachala Sahoo** to learn about his professional journey, his reflections on career milestones, and his advice for current students navigating their college years. Here's what he had to share:  

1. **Transitioning from College to a Career**:  
   "During college time, I was passionate about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). However, I didn't have a job immediately after graduating, so I joined JSpider to improve my skills. After two months, NI (National Instruments) had a placement opportunity focused on C++ and DSA. I grabbed the opportunity and got selected. Now, I am working as a Software Engineer at NI."  

2. **Career Journey and Milestones**:  
   "I don’t have one specific milestone that stands out, but I take pride in every step of my journey. It’s not just about career achievements; it’s about the impact I’ve made along the way, whether it’s with family, friends, or colleagues. However, if I were to highlight a career milestone, it would be where I am today. Reaching this point has shown me that hard work always pays off, and that is something I’m truly proud of. And that spirit continues to inspire me to move forward on my journey."  

3. **Importance of CGPA**:  
   "I don’t think CGPA is the most important thing. Don’t chase after CGPA—if you focus on understanding the concepts, a good CGPA will follow naturally. Many students work hard only during exams to get a good CGPA, which might feel satisfying in college but won’t help much in building a strong career. Instead, focus on building solid knowledge, which will not only improve your CGPA but also prepare you for the future. For most corporate jobs, a CGPA of 7 or above is enough. However, if you’re aiming for higher studies, a CGPA of 8 or above is fine."  

4. **Advice for Students**:  
   "I suggest to focus on building a strong technical foundation. As a CSE graduate, I highly recommend everyone work on DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms). It’s not only essential for college placements but also valuable for your future career. Many students think DSA is only needed for big MNCs like FAANG, but the truth is, it’s important for almost every company.  

   Make coding a part of your life. If you get stuck on a problem, try to understand the concept and come back to it later. Remember, coding isn’t just about solving DSA problems—that can get boring and may cause some to lose interest in coding. To keep it interesting, work on fun projects, like creating small games. This will help you stay engaged and enjoy the learning process."  

5. **Cherished College Memories**:  
   "College life is all about creating unforgettable memories, and my time at IGIT was no different. Some of my best memories revolve around the moments I shared with my roommates. One such memory was a spontaneous trip to Puri that we decided on at 2 a.m. in the middle of the night. Without informing our families, we packed up and left the next morning, full of excitement and anticipation. The trip turned out to be an amazing experience, filled with laughter and fun. However, the return journey wasn’t as smooth as we expected, as we encountered an accident. Despite that, the memories of that trip remain etched in my heart as one of the most thrilling and cherished moments of my college life."  

6. **Final Thoughts**:  
   "One more thing I’d like to share is to enjoy your college life—it’s a time that teaches you so much. Create the best memories and cherish them. Also, don’t depend too much on college placements. Instead, focus on improving yourself and building the skills that will help you land a good job."
